# Nazim-Discussion-Bot
Testing bot for the discussion features requested by Nazim

This is a typescript discord bot meant to track and award points for discussions for academic courses much in the same way that some websites do.

The goal is to have it work in tandem with discords forum channels and assign points based on posts and comments within them.

# Instructors should be able to:
- define requirements for posts and comments to earn points (character length, paragraph count, and having links)
- award additional points to posts that generate comments
- give awards and penalties to posts and comments that students make through discord reactions
- define custom periods of time with their own score limits and goals
- get the scores of every student (overall and by score period) in a csv document

# Students should be able to: 
- see their own points per score period
- be notified when posts or comments dont meet requirements
- be notified when posts or comments recieve an award or penalty
- be able to easily see the rules of the discussion scoring

# Additional Note
The intent of this bot is to eventually have its features rolled into UDCIS's own discord bot sage so the features are also made with that in mind
